# Approximating-MLE-for-multivariate-jump-diffusion-models
Implementation of paper of Kristensen, Lee, Mele: Approximate Maximum-Likelihood for Multivariate Jump-Diffusion Models with Applications to Finance.
"5.1 CIR_Vasicek.ipynb" shows the first exercise of Section 5.1 of the paper for now: approximating the transition density of CIR model $p(y,u|x,t;\theta)$ via Vasicek model whose transition density is $p_{0}(y,u|x,t;\theta_{0})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi\gamma_{0}^{2}}}\exp{abc}$.
